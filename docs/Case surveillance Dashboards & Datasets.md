## Case Surveillance Dashboards & Datasets

### Case Surveillance Dashboards

Thematic dashboards for monitoring various aspects of HIV care and treatment programming have been developed based on the core indicators included in WHO’s 2022 [*Consolidated guidelines on person-centred HIV strategic information*](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240055315). Standard dashboard visualizations developed with WHO’s guidance can be rendered at national or sub-national levels depending on user configuration.

Dashboards are served entirely by DHIS2 *indicators* as described in the next section. The following dashboards are available for routine analysis of HIV prevention activities.

#### HIV CS - 01. Case surveillance
